              <p>We are Ansan Ensemble, a collective of Musicians from around the world connected through Music. “Ansan” in Persian means “The Other Way”. True to its name, the Music of Ansan Ensemble is unique and has influences from Persian poetry, Israeli-Iranian Music, Indian classical shades and all this with a twist of rock, blues and Jazz.

                The core Group of the Ensemble is led by Siamak Moghadam, a Berlin based Setar-Daf artist/composer with Iranian roots. He is also the director of the Ensemble. Doron Furman is an accomplished Oud and Bass player and is well known for his improvisational prowess. On the Indian flute is Dr. Vijay Kannan, a composer and flautist based out of India, living in Berlin. He is a self-taught flautist and has been associated with various musicians and acts around the world. Matan Goldstein from Israel, the expert percussionist makes the Music of Ansan dance with his groove. The Daf player Kimia Bani from Iran, graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Music and Theater and is often seen in collaboration with many international musicians and bands.
